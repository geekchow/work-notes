# `xcodebuild` Introduction

## How the xcodebuild assemble an ipa from source code?

xcodebuild is a command-line tool used to build Xcode projects. To assemble an IPA from source code using xcodebuild, you would typically follow these steps:

    - Open Terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Xcode project.

    - Run the command to build the project.
    ```shell
    xcodebuild clean build -scheme <your-scheme-name> -configuration <your-configuration-name>
    ``` 
    
    - Run the command to export the archive as an IPA.
    ```shell
    xcodebuild -exportArchive -archivePath <path-to-your-archive>.xcarchive -exportPath <path-to-your-ipa> -exportOptionsPlist <path-to-your-export-options-plist>
    ``` 

The export options plist file contains information such as the distribution method, signing identity, and entitlements that are used to create the IPA. The resulting IPA can then be installed on iOS devices using tools such as iTunes or Apple Configurator, or distributed to users through the App Store or other channels.

## Why the ipa generation process is separated into two phases: build and exportArchive?

The process of generating an IPA from source code is separated into two phases, build and exportArchive, because they serve different purposes and have different requirements.

The build phase compiles the source code, generates the executable binary, and collects all necessary resources such as images, assets, and configuration files into a single package called an Xcode archive (.xcarchive). This phase is responsible for generating the binary that will be included in the final IPA file. The build phase can also include steps such as code signing and setting up entitlements, which are necessary for deploying the app to iOS devices or submitting it to the App Store.

The exportArchive phase takes the Xcode archive generated in the build phase and creates the final IPA file that can be installed on an iOS device or distributed to users. This phase requires additional information such as the distribution method, signing identity, and entitlements that are specific to the distribution channel being used. This information is typically stored in an export options plist file that is provided to xcodebuild during the exportArchive phase.

Separating the build and exportArchive phases allows developers to generate the binary and the distribution package separately, which can be useful for testing and debugging purposes. It also allows for greater flexibility in the distribution process, as different export options can be used for different distribution channels, such as the App Store, ad-hoc distribution, or enterprise distribution.


### The main difference between a .xcarchive and a .ipa file is their purpose and content.

A .xcarchive file is an archive of a compiled Xcode project that contains the compiled binary, as well as other resources such as assets, frameworks, and configuration files. It is typically used for archiving and distributing a build for testing, ad-hoc distribution, or submission to the App Store. It can also be used for debugging and profiling, as it contains information about the build process and can be opened in Xcode to view the project's source code and symbols.

On the other hand, a .ipa file is a package that contains the compiled binary, as well as other necessary resources such as images, audio files, and configuration files. It is the format used to distribute iOS applications to end users through the App Store, or through other channels such as ad-hoc distribution or enterprise distribution.

In summary, a .xcarchive is used for archiving and distribution of Xcode projects, while a .ipa is used for distribution of iOS applications to end users.
