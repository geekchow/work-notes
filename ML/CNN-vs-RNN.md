# Whatâ€™s the difference between CNN and RNN?

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are two types of deep learning models used for different tasks in artificial intelligence.

A CNN is used for image classification and object recognition tasks. It consists of multiple convolutional layers that filter the input image, extract features and reduce the spatial dimensions of the image. The final layer of a CNN is typically a fully connected layer that maps the features to the target classes.

On the other hand, an RNN is used for sequence processing tasks, such as natural language processing and speech recognition. RNNs process sequences of inputs, where the output of one step is used as input for the next step. The key feature of RNNs is that they maintain a hidden state, which captures information from the previous steps of the sequence, and uses this information to make predictions for the next steps.

In summary, CNNs are used for tasks that involve processing grid-like data, such as images, while RNNs are used for tasks that involve sequential data, such as language or speech.
