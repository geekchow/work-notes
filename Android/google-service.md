# Set up Google Play services


## Overview 

Google Play services powers a broad set of SDKs on Android to help you build your app, enhance privacy and security, engage users, and grow your business. These SDKs are unique in that they only require a thin client library to be included in your app, as shown in figure 1. At runtime, the client library communicates with the bulk of the SDK's implementation and footprint in Google Play services.

## Set up Google Play services

To develop an app using Google Play services APIs, follow the instructions on this page to set up your project with the relevant SDKs, which are available from the Google maven repository.

To test your app when using Google Play services, you must use one of the following:

A compatible Android device that runs Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher and has the Google Play Store app installed.
The Android emulator with an AVD that runs the Google APIs platform based on Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher.
